## Setup

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. 
This file will store your configuration and API keys. 
See `.env.example` for an example.

> **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file already includes it.

### Install UV Package Manager
Install the UV package manager by running the following command:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Create and Activate Virtual Environment
Synchronize dependencies and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Create Database
Run the following commands to create a database and user:

```bash
psql postgres -c "CREATE USER hackathon WITH PASSWORD 'hackathon';" && \
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE hackathon OWNER hackathon;"
```
